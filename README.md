Hello hello! My name is Maggie Ma, and I am currently a 
sophomore computer science major at CUNY Hunter College. 

Prior to this tech journey, I was a competitive classical 
pianist. I had been a musician for over 10 years, gave
private lessons to young children, and even went to a semester 
of conservatory at Manhattan School of Music. It was definetely 
not great for my mental health, and I was willing to let go 
of my past to explore other career paths that were better for 
my well-being. 

The tech industry has been poppin' off (especially as remote
work became more normalized during quarantine), so I gave 
it a chance, and here I am! It is very inspiring to see young 
underrepresented groups of programmers making an impact in
tech, and it is an ambition of mine to contribute to this
positive change.

Follow me on this journey of expanding my knowledge of 
programming! Hope to bridge the gap between my passions for the 
arts, business, and tech someday as an Asian woman in STEM. Looking 
forward to eventually enhancing the way that listeners experience 
music!
