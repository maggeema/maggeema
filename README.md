Hello hello! My name is Maggie Ma, and I am currently a 
sophomore computer science major at CUNY Hunter College. 

Prior to this tech journey, I was a competitive classical 
pianist. I had been a musician for over 10 years and even 
went to a semester of conservatory at Manhattan School of
Music. It was definetely toxic and not greta for my mental,
and I wanted to explore other career options.

The tech industry has been poppin' off(especially as working
remotely was more normalized from quarantine) so I gave it a
chance, and here I am! It is very inspiring to see young 
underrepresented groups of programmers making an impact in
tech, and it is an ambition of mine to contribute to this
positive change.

Follow me on this journey of expanding my knowledge of 
programming! Hope to someday be able to bridge the gap between
my passions for the arts, business, and tech as an 
Asian woman in STEM. Looking forward to eventually enhancing 
the way that listeners experience music!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
âš¡ Fun fact: I have a cute kitten named Tobi
