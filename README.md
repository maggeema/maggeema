# üí´ Maggie Ma!
Hello hello! I am currently a computer science major at CUNY Hunter College. <br><br>Prior to this tech journey, I was a competitive classical pianist. I had been a musician for over 10 years, gave private lessons to young children, and even spent a semester studying at the Manhattan School of Music. Although I thoroughly enjoyed that time in my life, I was willing to let go of my past to explore other career paths that were better for my mental health and well-being. <br><br>The tech industry has been making a huge impact, and I was inspired, so I gave it a chance, and here I am! It is very exciting to see young underrepresented groups of programmers making a change in tech and it is an ambition of mine to contribute to this positive influence.<br><br>Follow me on this journey of expanding my knowledge of programming! Hope to bridge the gap between my passions for the arts, business, and tech someday as an Asian woman in STEAM. Looking forward to eventually enhancing the way that listeners experience music!<br><br>üêà Proud cat mom to Tobi (aka Tobiason)<br>üå± Currently learning: Computer Vision with C++ and Digital Image Processing with Python<br>üéÆ Video game, mobile app, and UX design thinking instructor for Kodely<br>üë©‚Äçüè´ Volunteer Teacher Assistant for Microsoft TEALS Program<br>üèê Current hobbies: Volleyball and making weekly TikTok vlogs<br>üé∂ Go-to coding music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__UEp5EIMhQ<br>
